# 1) TaxRate: I believe the taxRate variable should be passed as a parameter in the constructor to accomodate the possibility of a varying tax rate. 	A private double instance var should be initialized but not defaulted to a hardcoded value.
# 2) Order: calculateTotalPrice method should be broken down into smaller methods. 
# 3) Email Sender: Delete email sender class and directly print phrases inside the sendConfirmationEmail method.
# 4) Item: instance variables should be FINAL as they are assigned to a value only once.
